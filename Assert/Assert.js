 * Add a assert method to javascript.
 *
 * Assert is a tester that is usefull to ensure stability and strength in the 
 * sructure of your code. For example, putting assert to test the type of 
 * arguements is a great way to ensure that everything goes as planned.
 *
 * Usage: 
 * first you have to import it: 
 * 
 * import Assert from "../../Core/Assert.js"; (the path might be different)
 * Since it is static, you don't have to make a instance of it.
 *
 * Assert.assert( 5 === 9, "error message" )
