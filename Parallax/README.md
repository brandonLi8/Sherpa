Parallax
=======
By [Brandon Li](https://github.com/brandonLi8)

## General

Parallax is the effect of making a scroll look like there is depth in the third dimension. This is achieved by making one element scroll at a different speed than the others. This is a module that allows a node to scroll at a user defined spee compared to the body. This only is only in terms of the body, so if you hav a seperate node that scrolls it will not work with this library.

-----------

Here's a simple example:

```javascript 
// import it
import Parallax from "../Sherpa/Parallax/Parallax.min.js"; // (the path might be different)


// Since it is static, you don't have to make a instance of it.
Parallax.addEffect( node, -5 );
// node will now scroll slower by a factor of 5

```
